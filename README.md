<h1>JavaScript ES6 Lesson Code from TutorialsPoint.com</h1>

<p>This repository contains much of the lesson code from <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/es6/index.htm">TutorialsPoint.com's</a> lessons on ES6 JavaScript</p>

<p>It is important to note that this is not a COMPLETE rendering of the lesson code.  I have edited things to match my own 
knowledge and style of programming.  For example, I have skipped most of the operators as I figure those are pretty standard.  In saying that, this is NOT a repo of lessons for a programming/developer beginner.  Some knowledge of general programming is necessary.  My lack of including operators is part of that.</p>

<p>I have also included comments in the lessons to explain how I understood the lesson.  I hope they help.  They do me.</p>

<p>My purposes in creating this repository are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Putting out there things I do in order that others may take advantage.</li>
<li>Deeper understanding of ES6 JavaScript as I use it heavily in Reactjs and Nextjs</p>
<li>Being able to use ES6 JavaScript even if I'm not accessing Reactjs or another JavaScript technology<li>
</ul>

<p>The root part of the repository is from an initial ES6 lesson that I can no longer find.  I have made modifications.  It is kind of a beginning portion, though I haven't commented it much.</p>

<p>As you see it right now, the repository is not complete, but I'll add to it as I finish lessons on TutorialsPoint</p>

<p>This lesson requires the installation of <a href="https://nodejs.org">Nodejs</a> and NPM (which install together, I think)</p>

<p>The TutorialsPoint code runs with</p> 
        node es6lessons.js
        
<p>under the Javascript_node folder.  It is recommended that you use it with:</p> 
        node es6lessons.js|more
        
<p>since the code is quite lengthy</p>
